  <h2>Ingredients – Brigadeiro Topping</h2>
  <p>
  Fun fact: In Brazil, brigadeiro is not only used as a cake topping — it is also one of the most iconic sweets at children's birthday parties. 
  People often make small round brigadeiros, roll them in chocolate sprinkles, and serve them in little paper cups. 
  It’s also a comfort treat that many Brazilians prepare just to eat with a spoon while watching movies or hanging out with friends.
