        <h2>Ingredients – Cake Batter</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>3 medium carrots, chopped (about 250g)</li>
          <li>3 eggs</li>
          <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
          <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>1 and 1/2 cups sugar</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ingredients – Brigadeiro Topping</h2>
        <p>
          Fun fact: In Brazil, brigadeiro is not only used as a cake topping — it is also one of the most iconic sweets at children's birthday parties.
          People often make small round brigadeiros, roll them in chocolate sprinkles, and serve them in little paper cups.
          It’s also a comfort treat that many Brazilians prepare just to eat with a spoon while watching movies or hanging out with friends.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>1 can sweetened condensed milk</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons cocoa powder or chocolate powder</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
          <li>1/4 cup milk (optional, for a creamier consistency)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <h2>How to Make the Cake Batter</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).</li>
          <li>In a blender, add the chopped carrots, eggs, and vegetable oil. Blend until smooth.</li>
          <li>In a separate bowl, mix the flour and sugar together.</li>
          <li>Pour the carrot mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients and stir until fully combined.</li>
          <li>Add the baking powder last and gently fold it into the batter.</li>
          <li>Pour the batter into a greased baking pan and set aside while preparing the topping.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>How to Make the Brigadeiro Topping</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>In a saucepan over medium heat, add the sweetened condensed milk, cocoa powder, and butter.</li>
          <li>Stir continuously to prevent burning, mixing until everything is fully combined.</li>
          <li>If using milk for a creamier texture, add it slowly while stirring.</li>
          <li>Keep stirring until the mixture thickens and starts pulling away from the bottom of the pan.</li>
          <li>Turn off the heat and let it cool slightly before pouring it over the cake.</li>
        </ol>
